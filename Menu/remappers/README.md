# Remappers - Study

Here one can find each "Remapper" scene, made to test and learn possible alternatives. 

Each "Remapper" scene takes the form of a Button node with a script following the same name

## [action_remap_button_origin](https://github.com/goodguyplayer/Godot-4.0-RemapButtonStudy/tree/main/Menu/remappers/action_remap_button_origin)

The original remapper study; It originated from [GUI Input Mapping](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/3.5-9e68af3/gui/input_mapping) and only slight edits to test and output the values on console;

## [action_remap_button_all_inputs](https://github.com/goodguyplayer/Godot-4.0-RemapButtonStudy/tree/main/Menu/remappers/action_remap_button_all_inputs)

A slight modification from action_remap_button_origin, made to accept alternative devices input; Like mouse clicks and joystick.

## [action_remap_button_one_device](https://github.com/goodguyplayer/Godot-4.0-RemapButtonStudy/tree/main/Menu/remappers/action_remap_button_one_device)

A modification which allows each button to focus on its own Device. Pointing to the same InputMap key, a button may only listen to either keyboard, mouse click or joystick.

## [action_remap_button_possible_null](https://github.com/goodguyplayer/Godot-4.0-RemapButtonStudy/tree/main/Menu/remappers/action_remap_button_possible_null)

An attempt to answer the question "How to set a input to null".
